*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS Session?*Initially I was struggling with the idea of fetch / merge vs pull. Ryan cleared this up for me. I got a better understanding of the benefits of fetching vs. pulling.*What concepts were clarified during the GPS? *Learning how to do an inline image in Markdown was very helpful. I was completely lost on how to do it.*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*I did not have a pair so I can't answer the first part. The guide was very good about answering my questions. I had a few questions regarding git procedure and how it is used in a real world application as a developer. Specifically I was curious about edit collisions / merge conflicts.*What still confuses you about Git?*I guess I just want to continue to make sure that I have the proper Git workflow whenever I'm commiting files. Sometimes Git seems to easy and I feel like I might be missing a step.*How was your first experience pairing in a GPS?*I was very nervous at the beginning of the Guided Pairing Session. I also did not have a pair so I got to be the driver the entire time. I think this helped a little bit from a perspective of repetition and reinforcing the ideas I learned.
